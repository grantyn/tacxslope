# tacxslope

This is an Arduino project to implement control of a scissor lift via Bluetooth LE (ANT+) from the Tacx Desktop App (TDA).

Background

Tacx (now owned by Garmin) provides an application to interface with their bicycle training devices. One aspect of the interface is a slope
variable to emulate climbing or descending. This varialbe will change the resistance the device provides to the drive train making it harder 
or easier to pedal the bicycle.

I have designed a lifting mechanism to lift or drop the front axel of the mounted bicycle electrically. Now, I want to create an interface
to the TDA to control the mechanism.
